# Poetry Interpretation Page

Welcome to your Poetry Interpretation project! This project will teach you professional web development workflows using GitHub Issues as specifications.

## Project Overview

You'll create a beautiful webpage displaying a poem of your choice, using modern web development tools and practices. This project uses GitHub Issues to track requirements - each issue represents a specification you must complete.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Initialize Your Specifications

1. Go to the **Issues** tab in your repository
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Select "Initialize Specifications" template
4. Submit the issue (don't change the title!)
5. GitHub Actions will automatically create 4 specification issues for you
6. The original issue will close automatically

### Step 2: Complete Each Specification

You'll have 4 specifications to complete:

1. **Professional Tooling Setup** - Set up npm, Prettier, and linters
2. **Semantic HTML Structure** - Create accessible, semantic HTML
3. **CSS Typography & Layout** - Design a beautiful, responsive layout
4. **Documentation & Deployment** - Document your work and deploy to Netlify

### Step 3: Track Your Progress

- Each specification starts with the label `status:todo`
- When you complete ALL requirements in a specification, change the label to `status:ready-for-review`
- Check every box in every issue - this is pass/fail with no partial credit

## Project Requirements

### Choosing Your Poem

Use the Poem from the Poetry Planning assignment

### Documentation Structure

Your project should follow this structure:

```
your-project/
├── index.html              # Your poem page
├── css/                    # Styles folder
│   └── styles.css          # Your styles
├── images/                 # Optional images folder
├── package.json            # NPM configuration
├── .prettierrc             # Prettier config
├── .htmlhintrc             # Optional HTMLHint config
├── .stylelintrc.json       # Optional Stylelint config
├── .gitignore              # Git ignore file
├── README.md               # This file (update it!)
├── project-goals.md        # Your vision for this project
│
└── docs/                   # Documentation folder
    ├── copilot-collaboration.md  # Document your Copilot usage
    └── evidence/           # Only 2 screenshots required
```

## Using AI Assistance

You're encouraged to use GitHub Copilot Agent with @workspace for context-aware assistance! Document all interactions in `docs/copilot-collaboration.md`. Include:

- The date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- What you were trying to accomplish
- Whether you used agent mode (@workspace) or chatbot mode
- The prompt you used
- What Copilot suggested
- What you actually implemented

### Key Learning: Agent vs Chatbot
- **Agent mode** (@workspace): Understands your entire project context
- **Chatbot mode**: Answers isolated questions without project context

## Deployment Instructions

2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Deploy your site
4. Customize your site name (no random strings!)
5. Add the live URL to this README
