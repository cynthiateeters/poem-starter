# Poetry Interpretation Page

Welcome to your Poetry Interpretation project! This project will teach you professional web development workflows using GitHub Issues as specifications.

## Project Overview

You'll create a beautiful webpage displaying a poem of your choice, using modern web development tools and practices. This project uses GitHub Issues to track requirements - each issue represents a specification you must complete.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Initialize Your Specifications

1. Go to the **Issues** tab in your repository
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Select "Initialize Specifications" template
4. Submit the issue (don't change the title!)
5. GitHub Actions will automatically create 4 specification issues for you
6. The original issue will close automatically

### Step 2: Complete Each Specification

You'll have 4 specifications to complete:

1. **Professional Tooling Setup** - Set up npm, Prettier, and linters
2. **Semantic HTML Structure** - Create accessible, semantic HTML
3. **CSS Typography & Layout** - Design a beautiful, responsive layout
4. **Documentation & Deployment** - Document your work and deploy to Netlify

### Step 3: Track Your Progress

- Each specification starts with the label `status:todo`
- When you complete ALL requirements in a specification, change the label to `status:ready-for-review`
- Check every box in every issue - this is pass/fail with no partial credit

## Project Requirements
