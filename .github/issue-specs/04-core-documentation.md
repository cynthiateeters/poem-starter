labels: required, documentation, status:todo
---

## Pass Requirements (All must be checked)

- [ ] project-goals.md exists and addresses this spec area
- [ ] Deployed to Netlify with custom site name (screenshot required in docs/evidence/ folder)
- [ ] copilot-collaboration.md complete with mode usage reflections (Ask/Agent/Edit)
- [ ] Meaningful git commits showing iterative development

### Status Signal
When ALL boxes are checked, change label from `status:todo` to `status:ready-for-review`

### Notes
- The repository and live site are your primary evidence
- Use GitHub Copilot's different modes: Ask for planning, Agent for building, Edit for modifying
- Only ONE screenshot required: Live Netlify site
- Focus on documenting when each Copilot mode (Ask/Agent/Edit) was most helpful
