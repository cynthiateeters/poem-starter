# AI Poetry Planning Assignment - Streamlined Guide for Claude Code

## Core Assignment Purpose

Students learn to collaborate with AI to plan a poetry website. This is purely a planning exercise - no coding, just thoughtful preparation with AI assistance.

## Simplified Structure

### Phase 1: Poem Discovery with AI
Students use AI to find a poem that:
- Interests them personally
- Works well for web presentation
- Has clear structure (stanzas, line breaks)
- Is appropriate for academic display

**Key Learning:** How to give AI context about your needs and iterate to better results.

### Phase 2: HTML Guidelines Development
Students work with AI to create a simple planning document that outlines:
- Which semantic HTML elements to use (header, main, article, footer)
- How to handle the poem's structure (stanzas, line breaks)
- Basic accessibility considerations (heading hierarchy, alt text if images)

**Key Learning:** How to ask AI for practical guidelines, not exhaustive documentation.

### Phase 3: CSS Styling Guidelines
Students collaborate with AI to develop:
- A basic color scheme that fits the poem's mood
- Two font choices (heading and body)
- Simple spacing guidelines for readability

**Key Learning:** How to connect creative vision with practical design decisions through AI collaboration.

### Final Reflection
Students write a brief reflection on:
- How their AI prompting improved
- Which AI suggestions they modified and why
- What they learned about working with AI

## Practical Focus Points

### Make AI Conversations Count

**Instead of documenting everything, focus on:**
- One solid initial prompt that provides context
- 2-3 follow-up questions that refine the output
- One example where you disagreed with AI and why

### Keep Guidelines Simple

**HTML Guidelines Example:**
```markdown
## My HTML Plan
- Main heading: h1 for poem title
- Structure: article tag for the poem
- Stanzas: section tags with class="stanza"
- Line breaks: br tags within p elements
- Author: footer with citation
```

**CSS Guidelines Example:**
```markdown
## My Design Plan
- Background: Light warm color (#...)
- Text: Dark color for contrast (#...)
- Heading font: [Font name] - formal feel
- Body font: [Font name] - readable
- Spacing: 2rem between stanzas
```

### Focus on Process Learning

**Document these AI collaboration patterns:**

1. **Context Building:** Start with personal preferences + technical needs
2. **Iteration:** Show how you refined AI's suggestions
3. **Critical Thinking:** Explain why you modified AI recommendations

## What Students Should Deliver

### Two Simple Documents

**1. planning-document.md**
- Selected poem and why
- HTML guidelines (5-10 bullet points)
- CSS guidelines (5-10 bullet points)
- Screenshots of 2-3 key AI conversations

**2. reflection.md**
- What worked well with AI (2-3 paragraphs)
- What you'd do differently (1-2 paragraphs)
- Ready for implementation? (Yes/No and why)

## Removing Academic Overhead

### Cut These Requirements
- Extensive conversation logs
- Multiple analysis prompts per poem
- Detailed accessibility compliance plans
- Mood boards and wireframes
- Exhaustive responsive design planning
- Meta-reflection on AI in education

### Keep These Essentials
- Clear poem selection with rationale
- Basic HTML structure guidelines
- Simple design decisions with reasoning
- Evidence of AI collaboration improvement
- Brief reflection on learning

## AI Prompting Guidance

### Phase 1 Starter Prompt
```
I'm a web development student looking for a poem to build a website around. I enjoy [interests] and prefer [aesthetic style]. The poem needs clear structure for HTML markup and should be 15-30 lines. Can you suggest 3-5 poems and explain why each would work well for a web project?
```

### Phase 2 Starter Prompt
```
I've chosen "[poem title]" for my website. Can you help me create simple HTML guidelines for structuring this poem? I need to know which semantic elements to use and how to handle the stanzas and line breaks. Keep it practical - just tell me what tags to use where.
```

### Phase 3 Starter Prompt
```
For my poem "[title]" which is about [brief description], I need simple CSS guidelines. What colors would match the mood? What font pairings would work? How much spacing between stanzas? Give me practical starting points, not complex systems.
```

## Common Student Struggles & Solutions

### "I don't know what poem to choose"
Ask AI for poems about topics you already care about. Start with your interests, not "good poems for websites."

### "AI gives me too much information"
Add constraints to your prompts: "Give me 5 bullet points" or "Keep your answer under 100 words."

### "I don't know if AI's suggestion is good"
Trust your instinct. If something seems off or too complex, ask AI for a simpler alternative.

### "My conversation with AI went nowhere"
Start over with better context. Tell AI exactly what you need and what constraints you have.

## Time Management

**Total time: 7-9 hours across one week**

- Poem discovery: 2-3 hours
- HTML guidelines: 2 hours
- CSS guidelines: 2-3 hours
- Reflection: 1 hour

**Don't spend more than 30 minutes on any single AI conversation.** If stuck, take a break and return with a fresh approach.

## Success Indicators

Students succeed when they:
- Can write better prompts by the end than at the beginning
- Have clear, simple guidelines ready for building
- Understand why they made specific choices
- Feel prepared to start coding their poetry site

## What This Assignment Is NOT

- Not a coding exercise
- Not a documentation marathon
- Not a test of following complex rubrics
- Not about perfect planning
- Not about impressing with quantity

## What This Assignment IS

- Learning to work with AI effectively
- Making practical planning decisions
- Developing critical thinking about AI suggestions
- Building confidence for the main project
- Creating useful reference materials

## For Instructors Using Claude Code

When implementing this assignment:

1. **Emphasize practical outcomes over process documentation**
2. **Encourage students to disagree with AI when appropriate**
3. **Focus on quality of thinking, not quantity of writing**
4. **Allow flexibility in how students document their work**
5. **Make the reflection genuine, not performative**

## Key Takeaway

This assignment teaches students to use AI as a planning partner while maintaining their own creative vision and critical thinking. The goal is practical preparation, not academic documentation.
