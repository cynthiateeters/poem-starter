## Phase overview

Work with AI to plan the semantic HTML structure for your chosen poem, ensuring accessibility compliance and responsive design considerations.

## Part A: Semantic structure planning (10 points)

### Planning conversation with AI

**Your initial structure planning prompt:**
```
[Paste your complete prompt asking AI to help plan HTML5 semantic structure for your specific poem. Include context about your poem and the technical requirements.]
```

**AI's initial structure suggestion:**
```html
<!-- Paste or describe AI's suggested HTML structure -->
```

**Your questions and refinements:**

#### Follow-up 1
**Your question:**
```
[What you asked to clarify or improve the structure]
```

**AI's response:**
```
[Key points from AI's response]
```

#### Follow-up 2
**Your question:**
```
[Continue documenting your iterative conversation]
```

**AI's response:**
```
[Key points from AI's response]
```

### Your finalized HTML structure plan

Based on your AI collaboration, document your planned HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- Document head planning -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>[Your planned title]</title>
    <!-- Other head elements you're planning -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your planned semantic structure here -->
    <header>
        <!-- What will go in header? -->
    </header>
    
    <main>
        <!-- Main content structure -->
        <article> <!-- or <section> -->
            <!-- Poem structure planning -->
        </article>
    </main>
    
    <footer>
        <!-- What will go in footer? -->
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

**Justification for your structure choices:**
```
[Explain why you chose specific semantic elements, how you plan to handle stanzas, line breaks, etc.]
```

## Part B: Accessibility analysis with AI (8 points)

### Accessibility review conversation

**Your accessibility analysis prompt:**
```
[How you asked AI to review your structure for accessibility compliance]
```

**AI's accessibility feedback:**
```
[Summarize AI's suggestions for accessibility improvements]
```

### Accessibility compliance plan

Based on AI feedback and your analysis, document how you'll meet WCAG AA standards:

**Heading hierarchy plan:**
- H1: [What will be your main heading]
- H2: [Subheadings plan]
- H3+: [If applicable]

**Text alternatives plan:**
- Images (if any): [How you'll handle alt text]
- Decorative elements: [How you'll mark decorative content]

**Color and contrast considerations:**
- Text color planning: [Note any contrast requirements]
- Link identification: [How links will be distinguishable]

**Keyboard navigation:**
- Focus management: [Any interactive elements]
- Skip navigation: [If needed for your design]

**Screen reader considerations:**
- Poem structure: [How screen readers will interpret your poem layout]
- Citation handling: [How author attribution will be announced]

## Part C: Responsive design planning (4 points)

### Responsive structure conversation

**Your responsive planning prompt:**
```
[How you asked AI about responsive considerations for your HTML structure]
```

**AI's responsive design suggestions:**
```
[Key points about how your HTML should adapt to different viewport sizes]
```

### Viewport adaptation plan

**Mobile considerations (320px-768px):**
- Structure changes: [Any HTML that might change on mobile]
- Content priority: [What's most important on small screens]
- Touch targets: [Any interactive elements to consider]

**Tablet considerations (768px-1024px):**
- Layout opportunities: [How structure might adapt]
- Content presentation: [Any different presentation needs]

**Desktop considerations (1024px+):**
- Enhanced features: [Any additional elements for larger screens]
- Layout possibilities: [How content might be arranged differently]

## Part D: Wireframe creation (3 points)

### Hand-drawn wireframe

Create a simple hand-drawn wireframe showing your planned layout at different breakpoints.

**Wireframe file:** `assets/wireframe-sketch.jpg`

**Description of your wireframe:**
```
[Describe what you drew and why you chose this layout approach]
```

### AI wireframe review

**Your wireframe review prompt:**
```
[How you described your wireframe to AI and asked for feedback]
```

**AI's wireframe feedback:**
```
[What AI suggested about your layout plan]
```

**Your modifications based on AI feedback:**
```
[What you decided to change or keep the same, and why]
```

## Integration planning

### Connection to Phase 3 (CSS)

**Structure elements that will need special CSS attention:**
- [List HTML elements that will require specific styling]

**Responsive breakpoints your HTML supports:**
- [Note any structural changes that will happen at different screen sizes]

**Accessibility features that will need CSS support:**
- [List HTML accessibility features that require CSS implementation]
