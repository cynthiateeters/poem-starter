**Student Name:** [Your name here]  
**Date Started:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**AI Tool Used:** [Claude/ChatGPT/Copilot/Other]  
**Points:** 30 total

## Phase overview

Use AI to discover poems that match your interests and technical requirements. Document your complete conversation and analysis process.

## Part A: Context building exercise (10 points)

### Your initial context prompt

Create a comprehensive prompt that gives AI the context needed to help you effectively. Include:

1. **Personal interests and aesthetic preferences**
2. **Poetry project technical requirements** (from main project specs)
3. **Any constraints** (length, language, copyright, etc.)

**Your prompt:**
```
[Paste your complete initial prompt here]
```

**AI's response summary:**
```
[Summarize the key points from AI's response]
```

**What you learned from this interaction:**
```
[Reflect on what worked well or could be improved in your prompt]
```

## Part B: Poem curation conversation (15 points)

### Conversation log

Document your complete conversation as you work with AI to discover potential poems. Include follow-up questions, refinements, and iterations.

#### Exchange 1
**Your prompt:**
```
[Your question or request]
```

**AI response summary:**
```
[Key points from AI's suggestion]
```

**Your follow-up action:**
```
[What you asked next or how you refined the request]
```

#### Exchange 2
**Your prompt:**
```
[Continue the pattern for each significant exchange]
```

**AI response summary:**
```
[Key points from AI's suggestion]
```

**Your follow-up action:**
```
[What you asked next or how you refined the request]
```

#### Exchange 3-X
**[Continue adding exchanges until you have 5-7 poem candidates]**

### Poem candidates discovered

List the 5-7 poems AI suggested with brief details:

1. **"[Poem Title]"** by [Author]
   - Length: [approximate lines/stanzas]
   - Theme: [brief description]
   - Why AI suggested it: [reason]

2. **"[Poem Title]"** by [Author]
   - Length: [approximate lines/stanzas]
   - Theme: [brief description]  
   - Why AI suggested it: [reason]

3. **[Continue for all candidates]**

## Part C: Technical analysis for each poem (5 points)

For each poem candidate, ask AI to analyze the HTML structure requirements:

### Poem 1: "[Title]"
**Your analysis prompt:**
```
[How you asked AI to analyze HTML needs]
```

**AI's technical analysis:**
- Semantic elements needed: [header, main, article, etc.]
- Stanza structure considerations: [how to handle stanzas]
- Line break strategy: [<br> vs separate <p> tags]
- Citation requirements: [author attribution needs]
- Special formatting needs: [any unique structural elements]

**Your modifications to AI's analysis:**
```
[What you agreed/disagreed with and why]
```

### [Repeat for remaining poems]

## Part D: Final selection and reasoning

### Your chosen poem

**Selected poem:** "[Title]" by [Author]

**Your reasoning:**
```
[Explain why you chose this poem over the others. Consider both personal connection and technical implementation factors.]
```

**AI's input on your choice:**
```
[If you discussed your final selection with AI, summarize that conversation]
```
