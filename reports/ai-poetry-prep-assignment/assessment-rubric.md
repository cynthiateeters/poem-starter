**Total Points:** 100  
**Assessment Type:** Practical preparation for Poetry Interpretation project

## Focus areas

This assignment is about **learning to work effectively with AI** and **making practical planning decisions**, not documentation quantity or following complex processes.

## Grading scale

| Grade | Points | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| A | 90-100 | Clear evidence of improved AI prompting skills, practical planning ready for implementation, critical thinking about AI suggestions |
| B | 80-89 | Good AI collaboration with solid planning decisions, some evidence of critical thinking |
| C | 70-79 | Basic AI collaboration with adequate planning, minimal critical analysis |
| D | 60-69 | Limited AI collaboration with unclear planning |
| F | 0-59 | Incomplete or missing significant components |

## Assessment criteria

- **Good (14-17):** Solid HTML plan with minor gaps
- **Basic (10-13):** Basic structure plan that covers essentials
- **Incomplete (0-9):** Vague or missing HTML planning

**CSS guidelines (20 points)**
- **Excellent (18-20):** Thoughtful design decisions (colors, fonts, spacing) that connect to poem's character
- **Good (14-17):** Good design choices with adequate reasoning
- **Basic (10-13):** Basic design plan covering required elements
- **Incomplete (0-9):** Vague or missing design planning

**Evidence of AI collaboration (5 points)**
- **Excellent (5):** Clear evidence of meaningful AI conversations that influenced decisions
- **Good (4):** Some evidence of AI collaboration
- **Basic (2-3):** Minimal AI interaction shown
- **Missing (0-1):** No evidence of AI collaboration

### Reflection quality (40 points)

**Evidence of learning about AI prompting (20 points)**
- **Excellent (18-20):** Clear examples of how prompting improved from start to finish, specific insights about what works
- **Good (14-17):** Some evidence of prompting improvement with general insights
- **Basic (10-13):** Minimal evidence of learning progression
- **Incomplete (0-9):** No clear learning demonstrated

**Critical thinking about AI suggestions (10 points)**
- **Excellent (9-10):** Specific examples of modifying or disagreeing with AI, with clear reasoning
- **Good (7-8):** Some examples of critical analysis of AI suggestions
- **Basic (5-6):** Limited critical engagement with AI responses
- **Missing (0-4):** Accepts AI suggestions without question

**Readiness for implementation (10 points)**
- **Excellent (9-10):** Clear confidence and specific plan for moving to coding phase
- **Good (7-8):** General confidence with basic implementation plan
- **Basic (5-6):** Uncertain but some readiness evident
- **Not ready (0-4):** No clear plan or confidence for next phase

## What we're NOT grading on

- **Length of documentation** - Brief, clear responses are better than long, unfocused ones
- **Perfect technical accuracy** - This is about learning, not getting everything right
- **Following complex processes** - Simple, practical approaches are preferred
- **Quantity of AI conversations** - Quality and insight matter, not volume

## Success indicators

Students who succeed will demonstrate:
- **Better prompting skills** by the end than at the beginning
- **Practical planning decisions** ready for implementation
- **Critical thinking** about when to use vs. modify AI suggestions
- **Confidence** to move forward with their poetry project

## Common ways students lose points

- Accepting AI suggestions without any modification or critical analysis
- Creating vague guidelines that won't actually help with implementation
- Not demonstrating any improvement in AI prompting techniques
- Missing evidence of meaningful AI collaboration
- Reflection that doesn't show genuine learning about working with AI

## Key takeaway for instructors

This rubric focuses on **practical learning outcomes** rather than documentation compliance. Students should leave this assignment feeling prepared and confident to start their poetry website, with clear guidelines they actually created (not just copied from AI), and evidence that they can work with AI as a collaborator while maintaining their own creative vision and critical thinking.
