# AI as Your Creative Partner: Planning Your Poetry Website

## Assignment overview

This assignment prepares you for the Poetry Interpretation project by teaching you to collaborate effectively with AI tools. You'll use AI to select a poem, plan your HTML structure, and design your CSS strategy while learning practical prompting techniques.

**Why this matters:** The Poetry project requires you to document AI interactions. This assignment teaches you how to get better results from AI and builds confidence before the main project.

**What this assignment is NOT:** This is not a coding exercise, documentation marathon, or test of following complex rubrics. It's about learning to work with AI effectively and making practical planning decisions.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this assignment, you will:

- Write better AI prompts through practice and iteration
- Use AI for both creative discovery and practical planning
- Make simple HTML and CSS planning decisions
- Think critically about AI suggestions and modify them appropriately
- Create useful reference materials for your Poetry project
- Feel prepared and confident to start coding your poetry site

## Simplified deliverables

Instead of complex documentation, you'll create just **two simple documents:**

### 1. planning-document.md

- Your selected poem and why you chose it
- HTML guidelines (5-10 bullet points)
- CSS guidelines (5-10 bullet points)
- Key AI conversations (copy-paste your best prompts and responses)

### 2. reflection.md

- What worked well with AI (2-3 paragraphs)
- What you'd do differently (1-2 paragraphs)
- Are you ready for implementation? (Yes/No and why)

## Timeline and phases

### Phase 1: Poem discovery with AI

Use AI to find a **PUBLIC DOMAIN** poem that interests you personally, works well for web presentation, has clear structure, and is appropriate for academic display.

**IMPORTANT:** You must use a public domain poem (no copyright restrictions). This means poems by authors who died over 70 years ago, or poems explicitly released to public domain.

**Key learning:** How to give AI context about your needs and iterate to better results.

### Phase 2: HTML guidelines development

Work with AI to create simple planning guidelines for which semantic HTML elements to use and how to handle your poem's structure.

**Key learning:** How to ask AI for practical guidelines, not exhaustive documentation.

### Phase 3: CSS styling guidelines

Collaborate with AI to develop a basic color scheme, font choices, and simple spacing guidelines.

**Key learning:** How to connect creative vision with practical design decisions through AI collaboration.

### Final reflection

Write a brief reflection on how your AI prompting improved, which suggestions you modified and why, and what you learned.

## Starter prompts

### Phase 1 starter prompt

``` text
I'm a web development student looking for a PUBLIC DOMAIN poem to build a website around. I enjoy [your interests] and prefer [aesthetic style]. The poem needs clear structure for HTML markup and should be 15-30 lines. 

IMPORTANT: I can only use poems that are in the public domain (no copyright restrictions). This means poems by authors who died over 70 years ago, or poems explicitly released to public domain.

Can you suggest 3-5 PUBLIC DOMAIN poems and explain why each would work well for a web project?
``` text

### Phase 2 starter prompt

``` text
I've chosen "[poem title]" for my website. Can you help me create simple HTML guidelines for structuring this poem? I need to know which semantic elements to use and how to handle the stanzas and line breaks. Keep it practical - just tell me what tags to use where.
``` text

### Phase 3 starter prompt

``` text
For my poem "[title]" which is about [brief description], I need simple CSS guidelines. What colors would match the mood? What font pairings would work? How much spacing between stanzas? Give me practical starting points, not complex systems.
``` text

## Success indicators

You'll succeed when you:

- Can write better prompts by the end than at the beginning
- Have clear, simple guidelines ready for building your poetry site
- Understand why you made specific choices (and can explain your reasoning)
- Feel prepared to start coding your poetry website
- Can point to specific examples where you disagreed with AI and improved the suggestions

## Time management tips

**Don't spend more than 30 minutes on any single AI conversation.** If you're stuck, take a break and return with a fresh approach or better context.

## Common struggles & solutions

### "I don't know what poem to choose"

Ask AI for poems about topics you already care about. Start with your interests, not "good poems for websites."

### "AI gives me too much information"

Add constraints to your prompts: "Give me 5 bullet points" or "Keep your answer under 100 words."

### "I don't know if AI's suggestion is good"

Trust your instinct. If something seems off or too complex, ask AI for a simpler alternative.

### "My conversation with AI went nowhere"

Start over with better context. Tell AI exactly what you need and what constraints you have.

## AI reality checks

As you work through the phases, you'll naturally discover some AI limitations. This is normal and valuable learning. Here are checkpoints to try:

### Phase 1 discovery check
- First, ask AI for 12 public domain poems with no other context
- Make a quick tally: How many authors are male vs. female? Western vs. non-Western?
- Then specifically ask for poems by women or non-Western authors
- Notice how much harder AI has to work to find these?

### Phase 2 fresh start check

- Start a NEW conversation for HTML planning
- Don't reference your previous poem discussion
- Notice how you need to re-explain everything?

### Phase 3 verification check

- After getting CSS suggestions, search online for your poem to verify it exists
- Check if the author/dates are correct  
- **CRITICAL CHECK:** Verify it's actually public domain (author died 70+ years ago or explicitly public domain)
- If not public domain, you must choose a different poem!
- If AI's CSS suggestions seem overly complex, ask: "Can you simplify this to just the essentials?"

Document any surprises in your planning document - this awareness will make you a better AI collaborator.

## Getting help

- **Creative blocks:** Try different AI tools or rephrasing prompts
- **Time management:** Focus on practical outcomes, not perfect documentation
- **AI tool access:** Contact instructor for alternative tool recommendations
- **Stuck on decisions:** Trust your instincts and ask AI for simpler alternatives

## What this teaches you

This assignment teaches you to use AI as a planning partner while maintaining your own creative vision and critical thinking. The goal is practical preparation for your Poetry project, not academic documentation.

**Key takeaway:** You'll learn to write better prompts, think critically about AI suggestions, and feel confident starting your poetry website with a clear plan.
