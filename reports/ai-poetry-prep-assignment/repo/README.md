# AI as Your Creative Partner: Planning Your Poetry Website

## Assignment overview

This assignment prepares you for the Poetry Interpretation project by teaching you to collaborate effectively with AI tools. You'll use AI to select a poem, plan your HTML structure, and design your CSS strategy while learning practical prompting techniques.

**Why this matters:** The Poetry project requires you to document AI interactions. This assignment teaches you how to get better results from AI and builds confidence before the main project.

**What this assignment is NOT:** This is not a coding exercise, documentation marathon, or test of following complex rubrics. It's about learning to work with AI effectively and making practical planning decisions.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this assignment, you will:

- Write better AI prompts through practice and iteration
- Use AI for both creative discovery and practical planning
- Make simple HTML and CSS planning decisions
- Think critically about AI suggestions and modify them appropriately
- Create useful reference materials for your Poetry project
- Feel prepared and confident to start coding your poetry site

## Simplified deliverables

Instead of complex documentation, you'll create just **two simple documents:**

### 1. planning-document.md

- Your selected poem and why you chose it
- HTML guidelines (5-10 bullet points)
- CSS guidelines (5-10 bullet points)
- Screenshots of 2-3 key AI conversations

### 2. reflection.md

- What worked well with AI (2-3 paragraphs)
- What you'd do differently (1-2 paragraphs)
- Are you ready for implementation? (Yes/No and why)

## Timeline and phases

### Phase 1: Poem discovery with AI

Use AI to find a poem that interests you personally, works well for web presentation, has clear structure, and is appropriate for academic display.

**Key learning:** How to give AI context about your needs and iterate to better results.

### Phase 2: HTML guidelines development

Work with AI to create simple planning guidelines for which semantic HTML elements to use and how to handle your poem's structure.

**Key learning:** How to ask AI for practical guidelines, not exhaustive documentation.

### Phase 3: CSS styling guidelines

Collaborate with AI to develop a basic color scheme, font choices, and simple spacing guidelines.

**Key learning:** How to connect creative vision with practical design decisions through AI collaboration.

### Final reflection

Write a brief reflection on how your AI prompting improved, which suggestions you modified and why, and what you learned.

## Starter prompts

### Phase 1 starter prompt

``` text
I'm a web development student looking for a poem to build a website around. I enjoy [your interests] and prefer [aesthetic style]. The poem needs clear structure for HTML markup and should be 15-30 lines. Can you suggest 3-5 poems and explain why each would work well for a web project?
```

### Phase 2 starter prompt

``` text
I've chosen "[poem title]" for my website. Can you help me create simple HTML guidelines for structuring this poem? I need to know which semantic elements to use and how to handle the stanzas and line breaks. Keep it practical - just tell me what tags to use where.
```

### Phase 3 starter prompt

``` text
For my poem "[title]" which is about [brief description], I need simple CSS guidelines. What colors would match the mood? What font pairings would work? How much spacing between stanzas? Give me practical starting points, not complex systems.
```

## Success indicators

You'll succeed when you:

- Can write better prompts by the end than at the beginning
- Have clear, simple guidelines ready for building your poetry site
- Understand why you made specific choices (and can explain your reasoning)
- Feel prepared to start coding your poetry website
- Can point to specific examples where you disagreed with AI and improved the suggestions

## Time management tips

**Don't spend more than 30 minutes on any single AI conversation.** If you're stuck, take a break and return with a fresh approach or better context.

## Common struggles & solutions

### "I don't know what poem to choose"

Ask AI for poems about topics you already care about. Start with your interests, not "good poems for websites."

### "AI gives me too much information"

Add constraints to your prompts: "Give me 5 bullet points" or "Keep your answer under 100 words."

### "I don't know if AI's suggestion is good"

Trust your instinct. If something seems off or too complex, ask AI for a simpler alternative.

### "My conversation with AI went nowhere"

Start over with better context. Tell AI exactly what you need and what constraints you have.

## Getting help

- **Creative blocks:** Try different AI tools or rephrasing prompts
- **Time management:** Focus on practical outcomes, not perfect documentation
- **AI tool access:** Contact instructor for alternative tool recommendations
- **Stuck on decisions:** Trust your instincts and ask AI for simpler alternatives

## What this teaches you

This assignment teaches you to use AI as a planning partner while maintaining your own creative vision and critical thinking. The goal is practical preparation for your Poetry project, not academic documentation.

**Key takeaway:** You'll learn to write better prompts, think critically about AI suggestions, and feel confident starting your poetry website with a clear plan.
