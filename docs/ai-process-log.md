## Entry 1: Setting Up NPM and Package.json

**Date:** 2025-09-15
**Context:** Starting the project and need to set up npm with proper scripts
**AI Tool Used:** Claude

### Prompt:

I need to create a package.json file for a web project that includes:

- Scripts for HTMLHint and Stylelint
- Proper metadata fields
Can you help me set this up?
```

- Showed installation commands

### What I Modified:
- Changed the project name to match my repository

### Learning Notes:
I learned that devDependencies are packages only needed during development, not in production. The --save-dev flag installs packages as devDependencies.
