# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to AI assistants (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **Poetry Interpretation Page** project for students learning professional web development through GitHub Issues-based specifications. Students build a single-page website displaying a poem while learning AI agent collaboration, modern tooling, and deployment workflows.

## Student Context

### Prior Work

Students have already completed:

1. **Sarah Jones Learning Site Study** - Understanding AI agents vs chatbots
2. **Project Goals Documentation** - Created `project-goals.md` with their vision
3. **GitHub Copilot Setup** - Have access to Copilot Pro with Agent capabilities

### Current Focus

Students are learning to:

- Use GitHub Copilot's @workspace for context-aware assistance
- Distinguish between chatbot mode (isolated questions) and agent mode (project-aware help)
- Build a website that matches their documented vision in project-goals.md
- Deploy to production using professional workflows

## Simplified Workflow Architecture

### Issue-Driven Development

- 4 streamlined specifications tracked as GitHub Issues
- Each spec has 5-7 clear requirements (pass/fail)
- Progress tracked through issue labels: `status:todo` â†’ `status:ready-for-review`
- Repository and live site serve as primary evidence

### Four Core Specifications

1. **Foundation** - Setup with AI Agent assistance
   - project-goals.md alignment
   - Basic package.json and tooling
   - Copilot collaboration started

2. **Structure** - HTML following the vision
   - Semantic HTML implementation
   - W3C validation (only screenshot #1)
   - @workspace review of structure

3. **Style** - CSS bringing the poem to life
   - Design matching project-goals.md
   - Responsive and accessible
   - @workspace assistance with styling

4. **Ship It** - Deploy and reflect
   - Netlify deployment (only screenshot #2)
   - Copilot collaboration reflection
   - Vision achievement assessment
